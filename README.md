# Embedded_Software_Engineering101

I utilized assembly and some C to write programs with the MSP430 launchpad in order to understand how timers and interrupts work. This was a lot of fun,            Hoping the concepts of memory management and computer architecture I learnt from playing around with microcontrollers will help me be a better software engineer !
